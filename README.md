# Class Artifacts

Hands on exercises from Todd McLeod's Udemy course,
[Google's Go Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code).
Great course starting with a thorough review of language basics, and ramping up to idomatic
code with channels, goroutines and an intro to conrrency patterns.
